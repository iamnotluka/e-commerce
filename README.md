# E-commerce

## Goal of the Project

Goal of this project was to get familiar with what it takes to build a full stack application from the ground up. I was familiar with some of the technologies however I know that this wasn't enough for what I have planned on doing. By building this project, I was eager to learn as much as I could and get exposed to problems I haven't solved before.

## Project Description

As title states, I was building an E-Commerce website. This website consisted of few pages and many web technologies. I have used React and JSX to bulid UI and HTML and CSS (flexbox, grid) in order to place responsive design into place. I have done state management with Redux (which is something I never used before) and stored data in the MongoDB.

On the main page, user would be presented with the list of products available in the store. By clicking on each item, user is redirected to the product page which has product description and info - user can also add that item to the cart from there.
In the cart page, user is listed with all of the items in the cart. This cart can be edited, items quantity can be changed, and user can remove items from the cart. Total price is automaticaly calculated and user is able to checkout.

User is also able to go through checkout process, where he is taken to the step by step process of giving the payment info. I have not implemented payment functionality in this project.

Finally, user authentication is something I needed as I wanted to have a difference between the management and the user. Management (admin) is able to go to products page and add, remove or edit products which are available in the store - main page.

## Technologies Used

Personal project built to learn technologies relevant to the MERN stack development. List of tehnologies used:

-   HTML5 and CSS3
-   ReactJS - Hooks, Router, Axios
-   Redux
-   NodeJS - Express, Web API, Body Parser, File Upload, JWT Authentication
-   MongoDB - mongoose
-   Development - Babel, Git, ESLint

## Future Plans

I would like to add management portal away from the website, which allows user to manipulate items away from the website where they are being sold. This project has been a learning challenge so I didn't focus too much on making it look good, so I would also like to change styling and make it a little more presentable.
